We've been stunned by the amazing reception to our demo, [Mythic Ocean: Prologue](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1155470/Mythic_Ocean_Prologue/), and now we're excited to announce that the full game launches in less than a month! You can wishlist it [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/814360/Mythic_Ocean/). We've put so much love and hard work into this game over the past 3 years, and we can't wait for everyone to experience it in full.
