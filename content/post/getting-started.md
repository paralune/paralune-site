We were brought together by a shared desire to tell interactive stories. We want our games to be accessible yet mysterious, with a strong emotional impact and an experience unique to each player.

We hope to surprise people with things they haven't seen or heard before, to give them a sense of wonder. We hope our players discover something new about themselves and the world around them.

Of course, trying to make games for a living is a crazy business. Discoverability gets harder every day and the market shifts constantly. Predicting a game's commerical viability is insanely difficult, and that goes double for a small studio making games that don't fit into existing tried-and-true genres.

Basically, we're navigating uncharted waters. It's hard not to be anxious about whether we can sustain ourselves.

And yet, far more than that, we're very excited. This is what we've wanted for years - to be self-directed and make things that have personal meaning for us. With such a small team it's easier to collaborate, have debates, and find the ideas we wouldn't have thought of alone. It's incredibly rewarding, and it makes all the risks worth taking.

We can't wait to show you what we have in store. Stay tuned!
