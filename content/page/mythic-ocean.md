## About the Game

Check out the Mythic Ocean [presskit!](http://press.mythicoceangame.com/sheet.php?p=mythic_ocean)

_Mythic Ocean_ is a single-player, first-person game that combines underwater exploration with interactive narrative. You'll meet and befriend a pantheon of gods, and your conversation choices will change how they feel and build relationships between them. The world they create in the end is determined by your influence.

The game is currently in development, but it can now be wishlisted on Steam!
