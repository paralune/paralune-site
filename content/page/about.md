Paralune is a 3-person game studio in Austin, TX, founded in 2016 with the purpose of creating emotional stories with deep interactivity.

Exploring the thoughts and feelings of the characters in our games is our focus, and players will be asked to make choices that have real consequences. Our players are storytellers, too.

Our first title is currently unannounced and in development, so follow us on social media to get regular updates.

As a freelance artist she has worked for several game studios as a concept artist, environment artist, and illustrator. She also has published works in comics and children's books. When she isn't stressing about her work she manages to enjoy the beauty of nature on hikes and will most likely be the first one to comment on how pretty the clouds are.
